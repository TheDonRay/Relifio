AI-powered emotional support through structured life chapters
Relifio is a mental wellness platform created to help people reflect, grow, and understand their emotional journey over time. Unlike traditional journaling apps or simple chatbots, Relifio turns your conversations into meaningful “life chapters,” giving you a place to revisit breakthroughs, challenges, and personal milestones whenever you need perspective.

This project is more than just an AI chatbot—it’s built to genuinely support mental health. In a world where everyone is constantly connected yet often feels alone, Relifio uses AI to offer comfort, clarity, and a space to express yourself. Whether you're navigating a difficult moment or just sharing an update about your day, Relifio helps you grow while capturing the meaningful chapters of your life.
